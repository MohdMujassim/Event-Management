The project "Event Management" is used to manage the booking for a USA based client who wanted to manage all the fitness events that they are hosting across the various states and cities in USA as part of healthy life style. The customer wanted to have a community(Ul) where any person who wanted to attend the event can see all the upcoming and past event. If the person wants to attend the event he/she can register for the event.
